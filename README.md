# NoNumerosity!
Game-based  assessments used in some interview screenings, which HireVue utilizes, are not particularally enjoyable or effective. This in-development Android app will automatically solve the arithmetic for one of them - Numerosity, instantly yielding the correct answer.

## What is Numerosity?

Numerosity is a games-based assessment tool used by HireVue. The objective is as follows: you are given a target value, an operand, and a list of integers. You must find the sublist of integers in an exact order which, when added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided produce the target value. This initially starts extremely easy, but becomes very difficult, stressful, and frustratingly irrelevant quickly for applicants - who are compared against their competitors based on their performance.

For an example of what you might be asked: provided a target value of 19, an operand of substraction, and the values of 46, 44, 35, 33, 42, 43, 30, 22, 18, 12, 10, 4, 5, find the solution. The solution would then be 46 - 22 - 5 = 19

## What is NoNumerosity!?
NoNumerosity! is an app which I quickly wrote within 24 hours of taking one of these tests for a software engineering internship role. You simply input into the app your target value, the operand you are given, and the values to choose from and the app will let you know what the first sublist of values that equate to the target value for the given operand are. 

## Examples
In this example, the answer to input into Numerosity would be: 95 -> 11 -> 38 -> 2
